Automation wrapper for stress-ng

Description: The stress-ng tool measures the systemâ€™s capability to maintain a good level of
             efficiency under unfavorable conditions. The stress-ng tool is a stress workload
             generator to load and stress all kernel interfaces. It includes a wide range of
             stress mechanisms known as stressors. Stress testing makes a machine work hard
             and trip hardware issues such as thermal overruns and operating system bugs that
             occur when a system is being overworked.  in double precision (64 bits) arithmetic
             on distributed-memory computers.  It can thus be regarded as a portable as well
             as freely available implementation of the High Performance Computing Linpack
             Benchmark.
